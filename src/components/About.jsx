            <div className='font-2xl text-sm pb-4 w-1/3 ml-auto mr-0 text-gray-400 flex'>  
              I cherished the netbook, as it allowed me to indulge in computer-tinkering, a luxury that my parents couldn't afford to provide me.

            <div className='font-2xl text-sm pb-4 w-1/3 ml-auto mr-0 text-gray-400 flex'>  
              I was addicted to the thrill of pushing the limited hardware to its limits. By the end of that summer, I had transformed the netbook from a cheap toy to a seriously capable personal computer.
